# Seattle Airbnb Open Data Analysis


### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Seattle Airbnb Open Data from Kaggle to extract useful information mostly about the price of properties. In particular, the data will be analysed to answer the following questions:

- Which are the most/less expensive neighborhoods in Seattle?
- What type of properties are mostly available in Seattle and how the price varies by property type?
- Which factors drive price the most?

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

### File Descriptions

- Data:  - listings.csv, including full descriptions and average review score.
         - reviews.csv, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments
		 - calendar.csv, including listing id and the price and availability for that day.
- A jupyter notebook with the data analysis.

### Summary of results
The results of the analysis are summarised in a blog post here: []()
