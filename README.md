# Seattle Airbnb Open Data Analysis


### Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Seattle Airbnb Open Data from Kaggle to extract useful information mostly about the price of the properties listed in the data. In particular, the data will be analyzed to answer the following questions:

- Which are the most/less expensive neighborhoods in Seattle? What is the %price difference from the overall average price per neighborhood?
- What type of properties are mostly available in Seattle?
- Which factors drive price the most?

In the current analysis only one of the three provided datasets will be used (the listings.csv).

### Install
